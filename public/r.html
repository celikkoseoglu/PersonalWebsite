        I just can't be myself when I see you
        because you're very cute tonight
        and I feel shy and sad and I
        look at you
        and I think I love you
        but you don't want me
        and that is very clear
        I should have noticed it for years
        but I still want you but not as a friend
        because...

        you're the man, I'm the girl,
        we look good together
        you with your hat, me with my boots
        we are, we are, the dandy cowboys

        I read today in a magazine
        that men don't like girls who are
        shy and sad so now
        I wear my magic smile, just for you
        I put my magic boots, I ride my magic horse
        I am so brave, I don't fear anything
        I don't even fear /.../ ?
        under my skirt , /I wrote all amends/?
        and give the money, to dady
        because...

        you're the man, I'm the girl,
        we look good together
        you with your hat, me with my boots
        we are, we are, the dandy cowboys

        and now I'm the richest girl in all the country
        you call me 'baby' you say you want me
        but honey, it's too late
        now I'm the queen of rodeo
        you missed your chance
        you're no longer my heroe

        you're bitching dady
        you don't respect the rules
        you stole my money
        and ran away with your poney
        and now I'm gonna kill you
        I'll shoot you in the head
        now I'm gonna kill you
        I'm gonna shoot you in the head
        because...

        you're the man, I'm the girl,
        we look good together
        you with your hat, me with my boots
        we are, we are, the dandy cowboys

        you didn't want me and that was very clear
        I will never never forget it
        but there's still a hope that hats and boots can get along together
        I still hope that hats and boots can get along together
        I still hope that hats and boots can get along together
        I hope that we get along</p>
