# Personal Website

#### https://celikk.me

So I've started project many years ago thinking I should start a personal brand going. I've initially started the project using pure HTML/CSS and the site looked terrible.

After getting some experience with HTML and CSS I was made aware of Twitter's Bootstrap, so I downloaded a template off the net and started modifying it. Soon after, it become a full fledged personal website which looked good for its date.

So I kept on updating and updating it as time went by. At first, this website wasn't in a git repo because git was too complicated for me at the time. I've created a git repo in 2016 and pushed it to GitHub. So some of its history is lost.

Long story short, this repo will have my personal website. Watch my website change while I make small modifications here...

# Running the Site

1. Make sure you have `firebase-tools` installed via npm
2. Then do `firebase serve` to test locally
3. You could try doing a `firebase serve` and follow the instructions to push this online!
